                It implements as follows. Addon create payment method
                (Debt journal). When customer buy on credit, he give
                "debt" to cashier, which can be considered as some
                kind of money. This virtual money (debts) is accounted
                just like usual money. But when customer pay debts,
                this virtual money (debts) are moved from debt account
                to cash (or bank) account
            </p>
            <p>
                So, positive amount of debts (debit) means that
                customer have to pay. Negative amount of debts
                (credit) means that customer overpay his debts and can
                take instead some product or take back that money.
